# #337 [Easy] Minimize & Maximize
## Description
This challenge is about finding minimums/maximums. The challenge consists of two similar word problems where you will be asked to maximize/minimize a target value.

To make this more of a programming challenge rather than using programming as a calculator, I encourage you to try to find a generic minimize/maximize function rather than just calculating the answer directly.

## Challenge
A piece of wire 100 cm in length is bent into the shape of a sector of a circle. Find the angle of the sector that maximizes the area A of the sector. sector_image

A and B are towns 20km and 30km from a straight stretch of river 100km long. Water is pumped from a point P on the river by pipelines to both towns. Where should P be located to minimize the total length of pipe AP + PB? river_image

## Challenge Outputs
The accuracy of these answers will depending how much precision you use when calculating them.

1. ~114.6

2. ~40

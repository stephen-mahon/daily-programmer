# #2 [Intermediate] Short Text Adventure

Create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name. The text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e, i, etc.").

For extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail, or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces.
